# Projects #

## CJEngine ##

  * CJEngine is a small 2D Engine which runs on Windows. It can handle sprites, and multiple picture format (PNG, JPG...). A sample application is available : Pong.

## AStar path finding ##

  * Creation of a small library that can handle the A Star path finding algorithm, which can be very   useful when dealing with games. It's also a need for the third step! This step is now   realized.

## Little audio engine ##

  * Realisation of an Audio Engine (CJAudioEngine), based on OpenAL. The engine has been developped in C++, and currently supports playing OGG and WAV files. Two modes are available for playing music: the first completly loads the music file in memory, for a fast playing after request (reserved for small noises) and the second is a stream decode based method, reserved for long background songs.
